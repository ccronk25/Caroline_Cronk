# CostumeArchive - Applied software project

This was essentially my capstone project, although I completed it the spring of my junior year. In this class, we designed and developed a solo project.<br />
The project I came up with was Costume Archive, an inventory management software for amateur and professional theatre costume shops. It was a combination of my interests, and a solution to a problem I've observed working in a costume shop.<br />
The code was developed in VisualStudio using C# and WPF. It is designed as a website, but I only ever hosted it locally for testing. I used Microsoft SQL Server to create the database that the program interacts with. All graphic design elements are created by me.
