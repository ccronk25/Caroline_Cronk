The Flower Game

This was my final project for the first computer science class I took at college. The course taught us object-oriented programming through basic Java. This project is
a small scale recreation of John Conway's simulation "The Game of Life." The rules and logic of the game are explained on the JFrame. While the activation 
method is clunky, I'm still proud of this, considering it was my first big project.
