# Checkers

After completing my first class, I was inspired to see if I could implement checkers with what I knew. The professor had mentioned that it was a fairly popular final project for that class. (For my final project, I had made The Flower Game/The Game of Life.)<br />
For the gameboard, I borrowed some of the GUI code that the professor provided for a different class project. The checker pieces are my design, though.<br />
I was pleased to get it almost completely working. Pieces can move in the legal way, take other pieces, turn into kings at the edge of the board, and the one with the last pieces standing wins.<br />
My one improvement to make is to allow for double captures, where if they're lined up right, a piece can jump over two enemy pieces in one turn.
