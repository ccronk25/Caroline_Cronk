This was a group project from a computer science course. The game is "3072," a variant on the online game 2048 that uses 3 as the base number instead of 2. I wrote
the code for the move, moveInt, and findAdjacent methods, and contributed to the combine and updateColor methods. I created the properties and constructors for the 
Board class. I made the design for the home screen, then used the Java GUI form on Netbeans to implement the design. I also connected all of the JFrames (HomePage, 
GamePages, and the instructions pop-up, the latter two created by my teammates) via the buttons so they would hide and show the same game screen rather than lose 
progress by going back to the home screen.
