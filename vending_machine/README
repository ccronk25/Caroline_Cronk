Vending Machine

This was an individual assignment for a computer science class that focused on data structures in object-oriented programming. We were provided with the 
IVendingMachine<E> interface and a list of required functionality for the program. We were required to create and use the Candy and Soda classes for this project. 
For one of the IVendable items in the miscellaneous vending machine, our professor instructed us to include the StarWarsCharacter class we had created for a 
fight simulator earlier in the course.
